## The "Why" - A Rant from the Author

I'll be honest. I love making plugins for Obsidian. It's fun, it's rewarding, and it lets me tailor my favorite app to my exact needs. But you know what I *don't* love? The ceremony.

Every time I wanted to tweak a tiny bit of TypeScript, I had to:
1.  Open my code editor.
2.  Run `npm install`.
3.  Run `npm run build`.
4.  Wait for my slow laptop to finish.
5.  Copy the `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` into my vault's `.obsidian/plugins` folder.
6.  Go back to Obsidian, disable and re-enable the plugin.
7.  Pray it worked.

And if I was away from my main computer? Forget it. Trying to get a Node.js environment running on a tablet or a friend's laptop, or wrestling with Replit or GitHub Actions just to compile a 50-line plugin... it was infuriating.

So, I built this. **In-App Builder** is my solution, **specially** for mobile. It's a plugin that builds other plugins, right inside Obsidian. It uses the magic of `esbuild-wasm` to compile, bundle, and spit out your finished plugin files directly into your vault. No Node.js, no npm, no command line. Just you, your code, and Obsidian.

## ‚ú® Features (What it CAN do)

Despite the warnings, this thing is packed with features because, well, I needed them!

*   **In-Vault TypeScript/JavaScript Bundling:** The core of the plugin. It uses a WASM-powered version of esbuild to bundle your code.
*   **Full Project Management:** Create, edit, and delete multiple build "projects" from a central settings panel. You can work on all your plugins from one place.
*   **Deep esbuild Configuration:** The project creation/editing modal gives you control over a ton of esbuild options:
    *   **Bundling:** `bundle` (of course!)
    *   **Minification:** `minify`, `minifyWhitespace`, `minifyIdentifiers`, `minifySyntax`.
    *   **Sourcemaps:** Generate separate, inline, or no sourcemaps at all.
    *   **Output:** Control the `format` (cjs, esm), `platform` (browser, node), and `target` (es2018, etc.).
    *   **Advanced:** Configure `define` for global constants, `external` for modules to exclude (like `obsidian`, which is excluded by default), custom `resolveExtensions`, and even file `loader` overrides.
*   **CDN Dependencies:** Need `moment.js` or `react`? Just add the CDN URL to the project's dependency list, and the builder will make it available to esbuild.
*   **Command Palette Integration:** Every project you create automatically gets its own command in Obsidian: `In-App Builder: Build: [Your Project Name]`.
*   **Robust Diagnostics:** If a build fails, it's not a black box. You can copy a detailed diagnostic report that includes project settings, file hashes, and the raw error output from esbuild to help you figure out what went wrong.

## üîß How to Use It

Ready to dive in? Here's the workflow.

### Installation
For now, you'll have to install it manually.
1.  Download the `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from the [latest release](https://github.com/Yuichi-Aragi/IAB).
2.  Create a new folder named `in-app-builder` inside your vault's `.obsidian/plugins/` directory.
3.  Copy the downloaded files into that new folder.
4.  Go to `Settings` -> `Community Plugins`, and enable "In-App Builder".

### Step 1: Create Your Plugin's Folder
Create a folder somewhere in your vault for your new plugin's source code. For example: `MyVault/dev/MyCoolPlugin/`. Inside that folder, create your `main.ts`.

```
MyVault/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dev/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MyCoolPlugin/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.ts
```

### Step 2: Open the Builder's Settings
Go to `Settings` -> `In-App Builder`. This is your command center.

### Step 3: Add a New Project
Click the "Add New Project" button. A modal will pop up. Fill it out:

*   **Project Name:** A friendly name, like `My Cool Plugin`.
*   **Project Path (Folder):** The path to your plugin's source folder. In our example, this would be `dev/MyCoolPlugin`. (Use `.` if your source files are in the vault root).
*   **Entry Point File:** The main file to start bundling from, relative to the Project Path. Usually `main.ts`.
*   **Output File Path:** Where to put the finished `main.js`, also relative to the Project Path. Usually just `main.js`.

The defaults for the other options are generally good for a standard Obsidian plugin.

### Step 4: Build!
You have two ways to kick off a build:

1.  **The Settings Tab Button (Recommended):** In the In-App Builder settings, find your project in the list and click the "play" icon (‚ñ∂Ô∏è). This method is great because it will show you pop-up notices for success, warnings, and failures.
2.  **The Command Palette:** Open the command palette (Ctrl/Cmd + P) and search for `In-App Builder: Build: My Cool Plugin`. This method is faster but **it will not show any notices**. It's great for quick rebuilds when you know what you're doing.

If the build is successful, the `main.js` (and a `main.js.map` if you enabled sourcemaps) will appear in your project's folder! You can then add a `manifest.json` and start testing your plugin in Obsidian.

This Plugin Works completely offline without needing an internet connection, unless you have set external deps via cdns.

## üõ£Ô∏è The Road Ahead (Future Plans)

This is just the beginning. Here's what I'm hoping to add when I'm not feeling lazy:

*   **Full esbuild Feature Parity:** Expose even more of the esbuild API in the UI.
*   **`package.json` Integration:** Automatically read dependencies and other build configurations from a `package.json` file in your project folder.
*   **Bug Fixes:** So. Many. Bug. Fixes.

### üì± Mobile Development & Debugging
Developing on mobile is tough without access to the developer console. If you're trying to debug your plugin on a phone or tablet, you're going to need a way to see `console.log` messages and errors.

I recommend using a plugin like **ScriptPilot** to inject the `eruda` mobile console into Obsidian. You can find it here:

You can even use this builder plugin to build ScriptPilot itself if you're feeling meta!

Enjoy the builder. I hope it saves you from some of the frustration it saved me from. Happy coding
